## FAQs

**I am not using Yoast or Rank Math, what can I do?**

If you are not using one of them but still want to use overlay image on top of your open graph images, you can manually set the link. You can get the generated URL to use from the plugin settings page (look at the right side preview with instructions).

**Do I need to upload certain sized image?**

It is best to use 1200px by 630px images as the source. For the overlay it can be any size that fits the source image size.

**How do I know what to use for X and Y in the plugin settings?**

X value is for the X axis and Y value is for the Y axis of the final image. You have to carefully measure the width and height and set the correct values. The preview shown on the plugin settings page can be wrong if not used properly. So, always test your output image first.
